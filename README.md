# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft MPC Controller (MATLAB & Simulink)

This project implements an MPC controller for the **L-1011 aircraft** using **YALMIP** (optimization toolbox) and **Simulink**.  
- The system results are observed using scopes.  
- The cost function, Integral of Squared Error (ISE), and Integral of Squared Input (ISU) are calculated.  
- The sensitivity to parameters, constraints, and the cost function is evaluated.  

Ultimately, the MPC controller is compared with an **LQR controller**.

## üìñ MPC Controller
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a feedback control algorithm that uses a model to predict future outputs of the process and solves an optimization problem to select the optimal control.

**Advantages of MPC:**  
1. It is a multivariable controller that can control multiple outputs simultaneously.  
2. It can handle constraints.  
3. It has preview capability.  

**Disadvantages of MPC:**  
- It needs a powerful, fast processor with large memory because it solves an online optimization problem at each step.

## üìê Theory of MPC
For a discrete-time dynamic system:


x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k) 


y(k)   = C x(k) + D u(k)


Here, \(x\) is the state vector and \(y\) is the system output.  
The goal is to implement a control signal \([u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n]\) that achieves the best performance with minimum effort.  

**Cost function:**  

![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\color{white}J_{(0-N)}=x_N^TPx_N+\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(x_k^TQx_k+u_k^TRu_k))

- **Q** demonstrates state deviation (performance).  
- **R** deminstrates  control effort.  
- **P** is the terminal weight.  

Because the cost function is quadratic, it is convex, so it has a unique global minimum.

## üîß Find Model for MPC (L-1011)

I use the [**COMPLIB library**](http://www.complib.de/) to find the state-space matrices of my system.  

- COMPLIB has more than 120 examples of real systems, which are linearized and LTI.  
- I use **AC3**, which is defined for a lateral-axis model of the L-1011 aircraft in cruise flight conditions, presented by **C. Edwards and S.K. Spurgeon**.

State, Input, and Output defined as

**States (x):**
- \(phi\) = Bank angle  
- \(r) = Yaw rate  
- \(p) = Roll rate  
- \(beta) = Sideslip angle  
- \(w) = Washout filter state  

**Inputs (u):**
- \(delta_r) = Rudder deflection  
- \(delta_a) = Aileron deflection

### ‚öôÔ∏è MATLAB Implementation
I extract the A, B, and C matrices from COMPLIB and put them in `plantac3.m`. Then I define a plant with these parameters and evaluate whether this system is controllable or not using the Kalman test.

```matlab
% System dimensions
nx = 5; nu = 2; ny = 4;

% State-space matrices
A = [0 0 1 0 0;
     0 -0.154 -0.0042 1.54 0;
     0 0.249 -1 -5.2 0;
     0.0386 -0.996 -0.0003 -0.117 0;
     0 0.5 0 0 -0.5];

B = [0 0;
    -0.744 -0.032;
     0.337 -1.12;
     0.02 0;
     0 0];

C = [0 1 0 0 -1;
     0 0 1 0 0;
     0 0 0 1 0;
     1 0 0 0 0];

D = zeros(ny,nu);

% Define plant
plant = ss(A,B,C,D);

% Time sampling
Ts = 0.1;

% Initial state
x0 = ones(nx,1);

%% Controllability check (Kalman test)
ctrb_matrix = ctrb(A,B);
rnk = rank(ctrb_matrix);

if rnk == nx
    disp('System is controllable')
else
    disp('System is NOT controllable')
end

```
