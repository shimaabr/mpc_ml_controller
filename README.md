# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft MPC Controller (MATLAB & Simulink)

This project implements an MPC controller for the **L-1011 aircraft** using **YALMIP** (optimization toolbox) and **Simulink**.  
- The system results are observed using scopes.  
- The cost function, Integral of Squared Error (ISE), and Integral of Squared Input (ISU) are calculated.  
- The sensitivity to parameters, constraints, and the cost function is evaluated.  

Ultimately, the MPC controller is compared with an **LQR controller**.

## üìñ MPC Controller
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a feedback control algorithm that uses a model to predict future outputs of the process and solves an optimization problem to select the optimal control.

**Advantages of MPC:**  
1. It is a multivariable controller that can control multiple outputs simultaneously.  
2. It can handle constraints.  
3. It has preview capability.  

**Disadvantages of MPC:**  
- It needs a powerful, fast processor with large memory because it solves an online optimization problem at each step.

## üìê Theory of MPC
For a discrete-time dynamic system:


x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k) 


y(k)   = C x(k) + D u(k)


Here, \(x\) is the state vector and \(y\) is the system output.  
The goal is to implement a control signal \([u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n]\) that achieves the best performance with minimum effort.  

**Cost function:**  

![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\color{white}J_{(0-N)}=x_N^TPx_N+\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(x_k^TQx_k+u_k^TRu_k))

- **Q** demonstrates state deviation (performance).  
- **R** deminstrates  control effort.  
- **P** is the terminal weight.  

Because the cost function is quadratic, it is convex, so it has a unique global minimum.

## üîß Find Model for MPC (L-1011)

I use the [**COMPLIB library**](http://www.complib.de/) to find the state-space matrices of my system.  

- COMPLIB has more than 120 examples of real systems, which are linearized and LTI.  
- I use **AC3**, which is defined for a lateral-axis model of the L-1011 aircraft in cruise flight conditions, presented by **C. Edwards and S.K. Spurgeon**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è MATLAB Implementation
I extract the A, B, and C matrices from COMPLIB and put them in `plantac3.m`. Then I define a plant with these parameters and evaluate whether this system is controllable or not using the Kalman test.

```matlab
% System dimensions
nx = 5; nu = 2; ny = 4;

% State-space matrices
A = [0 0 1 0 0;
     0 -0.154 -0.0042 1.54 0;
     0 0.249 -1 -5.2 0;
     0.0386 -0.996 -0.0003 -0.117 0;
     0 0.5 0 0 -0.5];

B = [0 0;
    -0.744 -0.032;
     0.337 -1.12;
     0.02 0;
     0 0];

C = [0 1 0 0 -1;
     0 0 1 0 0;
     0 0 0 1 0;
     1 0 0 0 0];

D = zeros(ny,nu);

% Define plant
plant = ss(A,B,C,D);

% Time sampling
Ts = 0.1;

% Initial state
x0 = ones(nx,1);

%% Controllability check (Kalman test)
ctrb_matrix = ctrb(A,B);
rnk = rank(ctrb_matrix);

if rnk == nx
    disp('System is controllable')
else
    disp('System is NOT controllable')
end


```

## MPC controller implementation

YALMIP is used to formulate and solve the online  MPC.  
I adapted the Simulink YALMIP-MPC example (https://yalmip.github.io/example/simulink/) and selected a fast QP solver / structure to reduce execution time.  
The implementation below is a modify YALMIP-based  MPC controller. In wich it get Q R  state at the moment (current x) refrence(current r) and time and give signal control (uout) to the plant. you can find my code in AC3controller.m 

```matlab
function uout= ac18controller(currentx,currentr,t,Q,R,N)
persistent Controller  % Store optimizer object across function calls

if t == 0 
%% define discrete-time parametrs for system model

 nx=5;nu=2;ny=4;

    0.0386 -0.996 -0.0003 -0.117 0;0 0.5 0 0 -0.5];
 B=[0 0;-0.744 -0.032;0.337 -1.12;0.02 0;0 0];

%% define u and x as semi definite program
u = sdpvar(repmat(nu,1,N),repmat(1,1,N));% U : N inputs of dimension nu

sdpvar r % Reference signal 
    
%% contraints of signal control
delta_a_max = 15*pi/180;  % 0.262 rad
delta_r_max = 30*pi/180;  % 0.524 rad

%% define cost funtion and objective function 
constraints = [];
objective = 0;
    for k = 1:N
        eror=r-C*x{k};
        objective = objective + (eror)'*Qbar*(eror)+u{k}'*Rbar*u{k};% Quadratic cost
        
        constraints = [constraints, x{k+1} == Ad*x{k}+Bd*u{k}]; % state dynamics
       

      % input limit
       constraints = [constraints, -delta_r_max  <= u{k}(1) <= delta_r_max ];
       constraints = [constraints, - delta_a_max<= u{k}(2) <= delta_a_max];
   
     
         
        
    end
%% Solve!
 ops = sdpsettings('verbose',2);%slover
    Controller = optimizer(constraints,objective,[],{x{1},r},u{1});Optimizer %takes {x{1},r} as inputs and outputs u{1}
    
    [uout,problem] = Controller(currentx,currentr); % Solve at t=0 
    
    if problem
        warning('MPC failed to solve at t=0');
    end
    
else    
     % use persistent optimizer
    [uout,problem] = Controller(currentx,currentr);
    
    if problem
      warning('MPC failed to solve at t=%d',t);
    end

end

end
```
at the next step i use yalmip example for simulink how ever change some part to adopt it for my example like indorder to get current x from the state space we set C=eye(nx)
and D=zeros(nx,nu) so the output of state space is current x then we give current x to mpc controller ,mpc controller also get T for whole of time duration in here 10 and get Q which is weight of error and R which is weight of signal out put mpc controller also get current r or refrence and after state space block we put  multiplay to get y=c*x then with scope we can follow the tracking 
also for better evaluation i find ISE and ISU and couse we have 4 output and 2 input i sum ISEs and ISUs to define a num for each for better asses in further
![ISE](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bg_white\ISE=\sum_{k=0}^{N}e^{2}(k))
![ISU](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bg_white\ISU=\sum_{k=0}^{N}u^{2}(k))
