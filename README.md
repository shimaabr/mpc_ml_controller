#  Aircraft MPC Controller (MATLAB & Simulink)

This project implements an MPC controller for the **L-1011 aircraft** using **YALMIP** (optimization toolbox) and **Simulink**.  
- The system results are observed using scopes.  
- The cost function, Integral of Squared Error (ISE), and Integral of Squared Input (ISU) are calculated.  
- The sensitivity to parameters, constraints, and the cost function is evaluated.  

Ultimately, the MPC controller is compared with an **LQR controller**.

##  MPC Controller
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a feedback control algorithm that uses a model to predict future outputs of the process and solves an optimization problem to select the optimal control.

**Advantages of MPC:**  
1. It is a multivariable controller that can control multiple outputs simultaneously.  
2. It can handle constraints.  
3. It has preview capability.  

**Disadvantages of MPC:**  
- It needs a powerful, fast processor with large memory because it solves an online optimization problem at each step.

##  Theory of MPC
For a discrete-time dynamic system:


x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k) 


y(k)   = C x(k) + D u(k)


Here, \(x\) is the state vector and \(y\) is the system output.  
The goal is to implement a control signal \([u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n]\) that achieves the best performance with minimum effort.  

**Cost function:**  

![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\color{white}J_{(0-N)}=x_N^TPx_N+\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(x_k^TQx_k+u_k^TRu_k))

- **Q** demonstrates state deviation (performance).  
- **R** deminstrates  control effort.  
- **P** is the terminal weight.  

Because the cost function is quadratic, it is convex, so it has a unique global minimum.

##  Find Model for MPC (L-1011)

I use the [**COMPLIB library**](http://www.complib.de/) to find the state-space matrices of my system.  

- COMPLIB has more than 120 examples of real systems, which are linearized and LTI.  
- I use **AC3**, which is defined for a lateral-axis model of the L-1011 aircraft in cruise flight conditions, presented by **C. Edwards and S.K. Spurgeon**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è MATLAB Implementation
I extract the A, B, and C matrices from COMPLIB and put them in `plantac3.m`. Then I define a plant with these parameters and evaluate whether this system is controllable or not using the Kalman test.

```matlab
% System dimensions
nx = 5; nu = 2; ny = 4;

% State-space matrices
A = [0 0 1 0 0;
     0 -0.154 -0.0042 1.54 0;
     0 0.249 -1 -5.2 0;
     0.0386 -0.996 -0.0003 -0.117 0;
     0 0.5 0 0 -0.5];

B = [0 0;
    -0.744 -0.032;
     0.337 -1.12;
     0.02 0;
     0 0];

C = [0 1 0 0 -1;
     0 0 1 0 0;
     0 0 0 1 0;
     1 0 0 0 0];

D = zeros(ny,nu);

% Define plant
plant = ss(A,B,C,D);

% Time sampling
Ts = 0.1;

% Initial state
x0 = ones(nx,1);

%% Controllability check (Kalman test)
ctrb_matrix = ctrb(A,B);
rnk = rank(ctrb_matrix);

if rnk == nx
    disp('System is controllable')
else
    disp('System is NOT controllable')
end


```

## MPC controller implementation

YALMIP is used to formulate and solve the online  MPC.  
I adapted the Simulink YALMIP-MPC example   https://yalmip.github.io/example/simulink/ and selected a fast QP solver / structure to reduce execution time.  
The implementation below is a modify YALMIP-based  MPC controller. In wich it get Q R  state at the moment (current x) refrence(current r) and time and give signal control (uout) to the plant. you can find my code in AC3controller.m 

```matlab
function uout= ac18controller(currentx,currentr,t,Q,R,N)
persistent Controller  % Store optimizer object across function calls

delta_r_max = 30*pi/180;  % 0.524 rad

%% define cost funtion and objective function 
constraints = [];
objective = 0;
    for k = 1:N
        eror=r-C*x{k};
        objective = objective + (eror)'*Qbar*(eror)+u{k}'*Rbar*u{k};% Quadratic cost
        
        constraints = [constraints, x{k+1} == Ad*x{k}+Bd*u{k}]; % state dynamics
       

      % input limit
       constraints = [constraints, -delta_r_max  <= u{k}(1) <= delta_r_max ];
       constraints = [constraints, - delta_a_max<= u{k}(2) <= delta_a_max];
   
     
         
        
    end
%% Solve!
 ops = sdpsettings('verbose',2);%slover
    Controller = optimizer(constraints,objective,[],{x{1},r},u{1});Optimizer %takes {x{1},r} as inputs and outputs u{1}
    
    [uout,problem] = Controller(currentx,currentr); % Solve at t=0 
    
    if problem
        warning('MPC failed to solve at t=0');
    end
    
else    
     % use persistent optimizer
    [uout,problem] = Controller(currentx,currentr);
    
    if problem
      warning('MPC failed to solve at t=%d',t);
    end

end

end
```
At the next step, I used a YALMIP example for Simulink; however, I modified some parts to adapt it to my model.  
To obtain the current state vector `x` from the state-space block, I set:

- `C = eye(nx)`  
- `D = zeros(nx, nu)`  

so that the output of the state-space block is exactly the current `x`.  
This `x` is then given to the MPC controller.  

The MPC controller also receives:
- **T**: prediction horizon (here, 10 steps)  
- **Q**: weight on the tracking error  
- **R**: weight on the control signal  
- **r**: reference input  

After the state-space block, I multiply `y = Cx` to obtain the measured outputs, which are sent to a **scope** to visualize tracking performance.  
In addition, process disturbances and measurement noise are modeled using **white noise blocks** as shown below:

<img width="800" alt="Simulink model" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f414008e-e04f-41c4-823a-efe509c577ea" />

---

For performance evaluation, I calculate **ISE** and **ISU**.  
Since the system has 4 outputs and 2 inputs, I sum the individual ISEs and ISUs to get scalar values for easier comparison:

$ISE = \sum_{k=0}^{N} e^2(k)$

$ISU = \sum_{k=0}^{N} u^2(k)$



Finally, in the **subsystem block**, I compute the **cost function** using `Q`, `R`, the error, and the control signal according to:

![Cost](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\color{white}J_{(0-N)}=x_N^TPx_N+\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(x_k^TQx_k+u_k^TRu_k))

You can find the full Simulink implementation in **`mpccontroller.slx`**.
